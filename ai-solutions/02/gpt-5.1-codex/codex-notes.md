# Day 2 Solution

Implemented in Python, JS, and Rust.

## Strategy
Iterate through all numbers in the given ranges.
- **Part 1**: Check if the number string is composed of a substring repeated exactly twice (length must be even, first half == second half).
- **Part 2**: Check if the number string is composed of a substring repeated 2 or more times (length % k == 0, pattern repeated matches string).

## Results
Part 1: 31839939622
Part 2: 41662374059
