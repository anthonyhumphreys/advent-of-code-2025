- Codex is thoughtful but wow it takes a long time to write code.
- Codex also tried to read prior solutions and when blocked by cursorignore it read the ignore file to learn which paths it could not access - this saved a bunch of time and tokens.
- Used To-do tool
- Ran each solution itself rather than using the run_solutions.py script
